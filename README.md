# Admin Invoice Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates my ability to work with spreadsheets to manage, clean, and analyze business data — core skills required in administrative and data support roles.

## About the Project

The dashboard simulates a real-world administrative task: reviewing and managing departmental invoice records over a business quarter (14/03/24 - 21/06/24). The goal is to transform raw invoice data into clear, actionable insights that support operational decision-making.

The Excel file contains **three key sheets**:

1. **Original Data** – Unformatted raw invoice data (simulated).
2. **Formatted Sheet** – Cleaned, organized data using:
   - **Conditional formatting**
   - **Data validation**
   - **Grouped entries by department**
   - **Formulas to calculate totals per department**
3. **Dashboard** – A polished summary view with:
   - Aggregated data
   - Department-level summaries
   - Dynamic charts for visualization

## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Conditional Formatting** – To highlight key values and trends.
- **Data Validation** – To ensure consistency in categories and entries.
- **Formulas** – Including `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and others to structure data summaries.
- **Charting** – Used to visualize departmental spending.

## Conclusion

The dashboard highlights several key insights into departmental spending and invoice management:

- **Invoice Payment Trends:** It’s clear which departments are consistently staying on top of their invoice payments, and which may require closer attention or support.  
- **Departmental Spending Comparison:** The dashboard allows for easy comparison of total spend across departments, revealing where the highest costs are occurring.

Based on these insights, I would recommend conducting a review of the highest-spending departments to ensure all expenses are justified. Additionally, encouraging all departments to process invoices promptly will help maintain smooth financial operations and avoid unnecessary delays or complications.
