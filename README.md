# Admin Invoice Dashboard Project

This project demonstrates my ability to work with spreadsheets to manage, clean, and analyze business data — core skills required in administrative and data support roles.

## About the Project

The project simulates a realistic administrative task: managing and analyzing departmental invoice data. It showcases how raw business data can be transformed into meaningful insights through spreadsheet tools and design best practices.

The Excel file contains **three key sheets**:

1. **Original Data** – Unformatted raw invoice data (simulated).
2. **Formatted Sheet** – Cleaned, organized data using:
   - **Conditional formatting**
   - **Data validation**
   - **Grouped entries by department**
   - **Formulas to calculate totals per department**
3. **Dashboard** – A polished summary view with:
   - Aggregated data
   - Department-level summaries
   - Dynamic charts for visualization

## Tools & Techniques Used

- **Conditional Formatting** – To highlight key values and trends.
- **Data Validation** – To ensure consistency in categories and entries.
- **Formulas** – Including `SUMIFS`, `COUNTIFS`, and others to structure data summaries.
- **Charting** – Used to visualize departmental spending.
